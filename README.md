# Phone Finder
Using this website users can search for phones by brand names like Samsung, Apple, and Huawei. I was use a third-party API to make this project. By default, it does not show more than 20 results. If any search results have more than 20 outputs it will display a Show more button. If we click the show more button it will show all results.
